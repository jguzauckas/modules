# Import our three modules here!


# Math
# Ask the user to enter a float number and save it to a variable.  Then,
# calculate the ceiling and floor of their number and print the results.


# Create a list containing all of your scores from assignments in this
# class from this quarter.  Calculate the sum and product of all of those
# grades and print the results with nice formatting.


# Have the user enter an integer from 1 to 50 and save it to a variable.
# Then, calculate the factorial of their number and print the result.


# Random
# Generate a random float and save it to a variable.  Print out to the
# user that their current grade is that random number formatted as a
# percentage with 3 decimal places.


# Use randint to flip a coin (think: how many options does a coin flip
# have?).  Depending on the random value, either print heads or tails.


# Datetime
# Create a variable that stores a datetime object with the current time.
# Print out the current datetime.


# Create a variable that stores your birthday from this year as a datetime
# object.  Print out your birthday.


# Use a comparison of those two variables to state whether or not your
# birthday has happened yet this year.
